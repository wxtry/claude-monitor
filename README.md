# Claude Monitor

**A floating macOS dashboard for all your Claude Code sessions.**

See what's working, what's done, and what needs you — at a glance. Hear it too — voice announces when sessions finish or need permission.

If you run multiple Claude Code sessions at once, you know the pain: switching tabs to check which one finished, which one is waiting for permission, which one is still thinking. Claude Monitor fixes that.

A tiny always-on-top panel you can drag anywhere on your screen. It shows every active Claude Code session with its status, project name, and last prompt. Click a row to jump straight to that terminal tab.

**And it talks to you.** When a session finishes — *"my-project done."* When one needs permission — *"backend needs attention."* Works out of the box with your Mac's built-in voices. Plug in an [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) API key for AI voices, or browse and switch voices from the built-in picker.

## Features

**Voice announcements**
- Speaks when sessions finish or need permission — no more tab-switching to check
- Works immediately with macOS built-in voices (zero setup)
- Optional [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) support for premium AI voices
- One-click voice generation — designs a custom AI voice from an included prompt and saves it to your account
- Built-in voice picker — browse your ElevenLabs library or paste any voice ID
- Per-event toggles and volume in `config.json`

**AI session titles**
- Automatically generates short descriptive titles for each session via Gemini API
- Replaces generic folder names with context-aware summaries (e.g. "部署监控面板" instead of "claude-monitor")
- Titles appear once enough conversation context accumulates (~1k tokens)
- Refresh button regenerates titles on demand

**See everything**
- Live status for every session: starting, working, done, or needs attention
- AI-generated title (or project name as fallback), elapsed time, and last prompt preview
- Color-coded status dots (pulsing cyan = working, orange = attention, green = done)
- Stale sessions automatically gray out after 10 minutes

**Stay in flow**
- Click any row to jump to that terminal tab instantly (Terminal.app + iTerm2)
- **Visual click guide** — a light orb flies from the click position to the target terminal window, with a glowing border pulse on arrival, so your eyes follow naturally
- Works across multiple screens — the orb exits one screen and enters the other
- Kill any session with one click (hover to reveal the X)
- Dead sessions auto-removed when the terminal tab closes
- Discover missing sessions with the refresh button

**Designed to disappear**
- Always-on-top dark glass panel, visible on all Spaces
- No dock icon, doesn't steal focus from your terminal
- Drag anywhere, resize from right edge, position persists across restarts
- Thin custom scrollbar, minimal UI footprint

**System notifications**
- Native macOS Notification Center alerts for session state changes
- Notifications for done, attention, working, and starting events — per-event toggles in `config.json`
- Click a notification to switch directly to that terminal tab
- Requires running as `.app` bundle — build with `bash ClaudeMonitorApp/build-app.sh`
- Works alongside voice announcements (independent config)

## Install

### The easy way (recommended)

Copy this **entire README** into Claude Code (or any coding agent that can edit files) and say:

> Set up Claude Monitor. Create all the files described in the README, configure hooks, compile, and launch.

That's it. The agent will create the files, wire up the hooks, compile the Swift app, and launch the floating panel. Takes about 30 seconds.

### Manual setup

<details>
<summary>Click to expand step-by-step instructions</summary>

<br>

#### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
xcode-select --install   # Xcode Command Line Tools (for Swift compiler)
brew install jq           # JSON processor (used by the hook script)
```

#### 2. Create directories

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/monitor/sessions
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
```

#### 3. Copy files

Download the files from this repo and place them:

| File | Install to |
|------|-----------|
| `claude_monitor.swift` | `~/.claude/monitor/claude_monitor.swift` |
| `build.sh` | `~/.claude/monitor/build.sh` |
| `config.json` | `~/.claude/monitor/config.json` |
| `summarize.sh` | `~/.claude/monitor/summarize.sh` |
| `monitor.sh` | `~/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh` |

Make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/monitor/build.sh ~/.claude/monitor/summarize.sh ~/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh
```

#### 4. Configure hooks

Add the following to your `~/.claude/settings.json`. If you already have a `"hooks"` section, **merge** these entries in — don't replace your existing hooks.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh SessionStart" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh UserPromptSubmit" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh Stop" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "permission_prompt",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh Notification" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh PostToolUse" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh SessionEnd" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 5. Compile and launch

```bash
~/.claude/monitor/build.sh
```

The floating panel appears in the top-right corner. Drag to reposition — it remembers where you put it.

</details>

### Verify it works

1. Start a new Claude Code session — it appears as "starting"
2. Send a prompt — changes to "working" with a prompt preview
3. Let Claude finish — changes to "done", voice announces
4. Trigger a permission prompt — shows "attention", voice announces
5. Click a session row — jumps to that terminal tab
6. Hover a row and click X — kills that Claude Code session

## Voice Setup

Claude Monitor speaks out loud when sessions finish or need attention. It works out of the box with your Mac's built-in voices — no account or API key needed.

### macOS voices (default, zero setup)

Ships with the **Zoe (Premium)** voice at 50% volume. If you don't have Zoe installed, your Mac will use its default voice automatically.

**To install premium voices** (they sound much better):

1. Open **System Settings** → **Accessibility** → **Spoken Content** → **System Voice** → **Manage Voices**
2. Browse and download any voice you like (Zoe, Ava, Tom, etc. — look for "Premium" or "Enhanced" variants)
3. Update `config.json` with the voice name:

```json
{
  "tts_provider": "say",
  "say": { "voice": "Zoe (Premium)", "rate": 200 }
}
```

Run `say -v '?'` in Terminal to list all installed voices and their exact names.

### ElevenLabs (AI voices)

For the highest quality, you can use [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) AI voices instead:

1. Get an API key at [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io)
2. Copy the included example and add your key:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example ~/.env
   # edit ~/.env and paste your API key
   ```
3. Update `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "tts_provider": "elevenlabs",
     "elevenlabs": {
       "env_file": "~/.env"
     }
   }
   ```
4. Open the settings popover (gear icon) and click **Generate voice** — this designs a custom AI voice from the included prompt and saves it to your ElevenLabs account. One click, done.

You can also browse your existing ElevenLabs voice library from the voice picker, or paste any voice ID from your clipboard — the app resolves the name automatically and saves it to your list.

The included voice design prompt creates a warm, softly synthetic voice — like a machine that genuinely cares. You can customize it in `config.json` under `elevenlabs.voice_design_prompt`.

## AI Session Titles

Claude Monitor can automatically generate short, descriptive titles for each session using the Gemini API. Instead of seeing folder names like "claude-monitor", you'll see titles like "部署监控面板" or "修复登录验证".

### Setup

1. Get a free API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Add it to `~/.env`:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. The feature is enabled by default in `config.json`. If you need a proxy (e.g. in China), add it:
   ```json
   {
     "summary": {
       "enabled": true,
       "env_file": "~/.env",
       "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
       "threshold_chars": 4000,
       "proxy": "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
     }
   }
   ```

### How it works

- When accumulated prompts in a session exceed ~1k tokens (4000 chars), a title is auto-generated once
- After that, titles only update when you click **Refresh sessions** in the settings popover
- If the API is unavailable or not configured, the project folder name is shown as fallback
- The `summarize.sh` script handles the API call — swap it out to use a different LLM provider

### Volume and toggles

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `announce.enabled` | `true` | Master on/off (also togglable from the gear icon) |
| `announce.volume` | `0.5` | Volume from `0.0` (silent) to `1.0` (full) |
| `announce.on_done` | `true` | Speak when a session finishes |
| `announce.on_attention` | `true` | Speak when a session needs permission |
| `announce.on_start` | `false` | Speak when a session starts |

## Requirements

- **macOS 14+** (Sonoma or later)
- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — the CLI tool from Anthropic
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** — `xcode-select --install` (for the Swift compiler)
- **jq** — `brew install jq` (for JSON processing in the hook script)
- **Terminal.app or iTerm2**
- (Optional) [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) API key for AI session titles
- (Optional) [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) API key for AI voices

## How It Works

```
Claude Code hook fires
        |
        v
monitor.sh writes session JSON to ~/.claude/monitor/sessions/{id}.json
        |
        v
Swift app polls directory every 500ms, picks up changes
        |
        v
Floating panel updates: status dot, project name, prompt preview, elapsed time
        |
        v
Click row → light orb flies to target window + AppleScript activates the tab
TTS → announces "project done" or "project needs attention"
```

Each Claude Code lifecycle event maps to a session status:

| Event | Status | Voice |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Session starts | `starting` | Optional (off by default) |
| You send a prompt | `working` | No |
| Claude finishes | `done` | Yes |
| Claude needs permission | `attention` | Yes |
| You grant permission | `working` | No |
| You exit Claude Code | Removed after 5s | No |
| Terminal tab closed | Auto-removed | No |

See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full technical deep-dive.

## Configuration

Full config reference: [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

```json
{
  "tts_provider": "say",
  "elevenlabs": {
    "env_file": "~/.env",
    "model": "eleven_multilingual_v2",
    "stability": 0.5,
    "similarity_boost": 0.75,
    "voice_design_prompt": "Soft, androgynous male voice with a clear synthetic quality...",
    "voice_design_name": "claude-monitor"
  },
  "say": { "voice": "Zoe (Premium)", "rate": 200 },
  "announce": {
    "enabled": true,
    "on_done": true,
    "on_attention": true,
    "on_start": false,
    "volume": 0.5
  },
  "voices": [],
  "summary": {
    "enabled": true,
    "env_file": "~/.env",
    "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
    "threshold_chars": 4000,
    "proxy": ""
  },

    "on_starting": false,
    "on_working": true,
    "on_done": true,
    "on_attention": true
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions. Quick fixes:

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Sessions don't appear | Send a new prompt in that session to trigger the hook |
| Click doesn't switch tabs | Check that `terminal_session_id` is set in the session JSON |
| Titles not generating | Check `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `~/.env`, verify `summary.enabled` is `true`, check proxy if needed |
| No voice | Verify `announce.enabled` is `true` and `volume` > `0` |
| Wrong voice | Run `say -v '?'` to find the exact voice name, update `say.voice` |
| Panel gone | `pkill -9 claude_monitor && ~/.claude/monitor/build.sh` |
| Wrong position | `defaults delete claude_monitor monitorX && defaults delete claude_monitor monitorY` then rebuild |

## Uninstall

```bash
pkill claude_monitor
rm -rf ~/.claude/monitor
rm ~/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh
```

Then remove the 5 hook entries (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `Notification`, `SessionEnd`) from `~/.claude/settings.json`.
